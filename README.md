DMG Emulator
===

Simple Gameboy Emulator using SDL in C++/SDL.

The Makefile only supports OS X (10.8 or later) at the moment and probably require some tweaking depending on where your SDL is installed at.  This project isn't being actively maintained but I might pick it up again at a later time.

Build instructions:
    # make
    # ./dmg <rom>

The only supported input is the keyboard. Key re-mapping is not supported.
- A is 'a'
- B is 's'
- Select is 'z'
- Start is 'x'
- Arrow keys

Don't ask me where to find ROMs.
